        <h2>Kourtney Kardashian on Why Eating Gluten is Not Okay</h2>
          <p>Kourtney Kardashian is a celebrity known for her advocacy of a healthy lifestyle. In recent years, she has been vocal about her decision to cut out gluten from her diet. In a 2019 interview with Health magazine, Kardashian explained her reasoning behind this dietary choice.
          </p>
          <p>According to Kardashian, her decision to cut out gluten came after she experienced a number of health issues. She noticed that when she ate gluten-containing foods, she would feel bloated, tired, and would experience skin breakouts. After consulting with a nutritionist and doing some research, she concluded that she was sensitive to gluten and made the decision to eliminate it from her diet.
          </p>
          <p>While some critics have dismissed Kardashian's decision as a fad diet, she maintains that it is a choice she made for her own health and well-being. She is also quick to point out that gluten-free does not necessarily mean healthy, and that it is still important to make healthy choices within the context of a gluten-free diet.
          </p>
          <p>Despite some controversy surrounding gluten-free diets, there is some evidence to suggest that they can be beneficial for people with certain health conditions. For example, people with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption, must avoid gluten completely. In addition, some people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience digestive discomfort when they consume gluten-containing foods.
          </p>
          <p>Overall, while there may be debate about the benefits and drawbacks of a gluten-free diet, it is clear that Kourtney Kardashian made the decision to cut out gluten based on her own experiences and personal health concerns. As with any dietary choice, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional and make informed decisions about what works best for your body and your overall health goals.
